Cops and Robbers is a graph theory problem that comes under the category of pursuit-evasion problems.

<ul>
	<li>A graph with v vertices and e edges is given</li>
	<li>Two vertices are assigned as the cop node and the robber node respectively</li>
	<li>If after some combination of moves, the cop node and robber node coincide, the cop wins the game and the graph is said to be a cop-win graph</li>
	<li>If it is impossible for the cop to get the robber after any-sequence of moves, the graph is said to be a robber-win graph</li>
	<li>It can safely be assumed that both the cop and the robber will play optimally</li>
</ul>
