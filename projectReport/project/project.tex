\subsection{Definition 1: Cycle}
A sub-graph or a graph having all its vertices connected in a closed chain is called a cycle. 
\subsection{Definition 2: Chordless Cycle}
A sub-graph or a graph such that each vertex is connected to no more than two other vertices of the cycle. 
\subsection{Theorem 1: A graph having a chordless cycle of more than 3 nodes is a robber-win graph in a 1 cop, 1 robber game (It is being assumed that the cop and the robber are playing optimally)}
Let $P(n)$ be the proposition that a graph with a chordless cycle having $n$ nodes is a robber-win graph. 
We will show that $P(n)$ is true $\forall n > 3,\,\,\,n\in N$ by inducting on $n$ 
This will prove the given Theorem
